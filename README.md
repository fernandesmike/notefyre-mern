## Learnings

### UI (Client, Frontend)

1. Make use of css resets
2. You can include basic typographic styles: line-height and default font size in the css reset
3. `<section>` vs `<article>`. `<section>` is like `<div>` but more meaningful as it can be used to wrap related elements altogether while `<article>` is used for independent elements. Independent elements are contents where it can still make sense if being separated from other elements.
